  _missionShortBrief: Building the Arches
  _missionDescription: At this early stage of the bridge's development, we must work
    together to successfully construct the bridge's arches, allowing for greater
    support of the various later stages of development. One problem, workers on site
    have been faced with a nasty <color=yellow>burst pipe</color=yellow> that seems
    to have a mind of its own! Seems like we may need a <color=yellow>Plumber</color=yellow>
    on deck!
