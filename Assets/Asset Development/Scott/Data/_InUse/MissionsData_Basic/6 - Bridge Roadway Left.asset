  _missionName: Suspend Deck (Left)
  _missionShortBrief: Suspending the Left Side of the Deck
  _missionDescription: The left side of the bridge deck needs to be suspended in
    a way that ensures proper alignment and support. Your mission is to coordinate
    the suspension process effectively, though a particular issue has arisen that
    needs your attention, a  <color=yellow>massive cinderblock</color=yellow> has
    unexpectedly fallen onto the deck, making suspension difficult.  You must remove
    it and ensure the left side hangs securely, with the help of a <color=yellow>Machine
    Operator</color=yellow>, this should be doable. The success of this task is vital
    for the overall stability of the bridge. Gather your team and get on it!!
