  _info: Establishing bridge pylon foundations in a river involves initial riverbed
    excavation, followed by drilling or pile driving for foundation support. Precise
    measurements and underwater concrete placement are crucial. Then, protective
    measures like cofferdams or sheet piles create a dry workspace, enabling construction
    of stable, secure pylon foundations.
