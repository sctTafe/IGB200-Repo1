  _bio: Alex's career in plumbing came about after she chose to enrol in a Certificate
    III in Plumbing at TAFE. Though she wasn't sure what area she wanted to specialise
    in, she quickly took interest in large-scale systems and how they work, making
    her the perfect fit for industrial plumbing. Over a few years of experience,
    she took on the role of Industrial Plumber, now excelling in setting up and maintaining
    plumbing for industrial infrastructure projects.
