  _bio: Introducing Mike, our Bridge Carpenter. Starting as an apprentice, he embarked
    on his journey as a construction labourer, learning the ropes on various job
    sites. Mike's fascination with large structures makes this area a perfect fit,
    and after years of experience, he now expertly constructs and maintains safe,
    reliable bridge structures.
