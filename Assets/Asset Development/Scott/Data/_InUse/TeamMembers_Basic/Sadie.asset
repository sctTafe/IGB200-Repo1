  _bio: Sadie is a Formwork Carpenter, someone who specialises in constructing temporary
    forms used to mould and shape concrete during a project's construction. She's
    always been a hard worker, and after obtaining her Certificate III in Carpentry
    through TAFE, she continued to gain experience in formwork on-site, eventually
    becoming the skilled worker she is today.
